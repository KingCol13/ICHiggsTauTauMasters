Generally use SWAN for fast code and plots.
Use .py scripts for long training because SWAN can kick you off.
Can use PyRoot or RootPy for Lorentz boosts.

Theory:
    Prefer NMSSM/CNMSSm to 2HDM models
    We can look at unexcluded parameterspace
    Could publish separate theory paper or include in supplementary
