    "Setup a NN to regress aco_angle_1 - this will give us some ideas about how we need to setup the NN in order for it to make use of the low-level information and then we can use a similar architecture for our final NN setup. After reading around online a bit one possible reason that the NN is not working very well is because the CP observables depend on what rest frame you determine them in and possibly the NN is not well setup to handle Lorentz boosts into different frames. I found a paper which suggest how to setup the first layers of a NN in order to perform such Lorentz boosts (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.09722.pdf) - this might be a good place to start, but of course if you have other ideas you are free to follow themSet up a Neural Network to reconstruct the aco_angle_1 from basic variables.
