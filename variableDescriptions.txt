Useful materials

A useful paper describing the use of DNN to increase CP-even vs CP-odd seperation for events with rho's and a1's: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.02609.pdf
and these slides build on this work including also information on the MET: https://indico.cern.ch/event/546109/contributions/2348814/attachments/1394491/2125280/Epiphany-17-01-12.pdf

A few definitions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this document a few abbreviations/acronyms are used, I will try to define these all here for convinience:
  - The events are grouped by channel depending on whether we have 2 hadronic tau's, or a electron/muon and 1 hadronic tau
    These channels are named tt, et, mt where "t" indicates a hadronic tau, "e" a tau->electron decay, and "m" a tau->muon decay
  - The impact parameter named "ip"/"IP" is the point of closest approach between the primary-vertex (PV) and a track 
  - "pi" will be used to refer to a charged pion, and "pi0" will refer to a neutral pion
  - "gam"/"gamma" will refer to a photon from a pi0 decay (pi0->2gamma) 
  - The missing transverse momenta due to presense of undetectable neutrinos is refered to as "MET"/"met"

Exmples 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains 2 examples to get you started:

- Example 1 trains a BDT to differentiate the CP-even and CP-odd scenarios. Two BDT's are trained and compared, the first uses on the best simple variable as input, and the second includes additional variables to demonstrate that the seperation can be improved by including additional information

- Example 2 trains a simple neural network to differentiate between the CP-even and CP-odd scenarios.

Explanation of input files for training 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The root files in this directory contain the ntuples needed to perform the training. 
The files with "GluGluH" in the names contain Higgs events produced by gluon-gluon fusion. 
The files with "VBFH" in the named contain Higgs events produced by vector-boson fusion.
The files named *_tt_* contain events with 2 hadronic tau candidates, *_mt_* contain events with 1 tau->muon and 1 hadronic tau candidate, and *_et_* contain events with 1 tau->electron and 1 hadronic tau candidate.
The variables included in these files will be described below:

** Note: For a1 channels not all information needed is currently in ntuples, it will be added in future **

Generator level variables. Not to be used in training but needed to select CP-scenarios and/or define targets for MVAs:

 wt_cp_sm  - ME weight for CP-even scenario  
 wt_cp_ps  - ME weight for CP-odd scenario
 wt_cp_mm  - ME weight for CP-mixed (phi = 45 degrees) scenario
 tauFlag_1 - an integer indicating the true decay-mode of the leading hadronic tau (tt only) [0=pi, 1=rho, 2=a1(->pi+2pi0), 10=a1(->3pi), 11=3pi+pi0, -1=others]
 tauFlag_2 - an integer indicating the true decay-mode of the sub-leading hadronic tua (tt), or of the hadronic tau (et and mt) [0=pi, 1=rho, 2=a1(->pi+2pi0), 10=a1(->3pi), 11=3pi+pi0, -1=others]
 gen_phitt - defined as the "most likly CP-mixing angle). Defined as angle that maximises: cos(phi)^2*wt_cp_sm + sin(phi)^2*wt_cp_ps + 2*cos(phi)*sin(phi)*(wt_cp_mm-wt_cp_sm/2-wt_cp_ps/2)
 rand      - a random number unique to each event (not really a gen-level quantity but should not be used in training)

Selecting different tau decay modes
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The different tau decay-modes are selected using the mva_dm_{1,2} and tau_decay_mode_{1,2} variables
The variables ending with *_1 correspond to the leading hadrnoic tau (tt channel only), and those ending with *_2 correspond to the sub-leading hadronic tau (tt) or the hadronic tau (et and mt).
The following selections are used to select pi, rho, a1:

  pi:  mva_dm_{1,2}==0
  rho: mva_dm_{1,2}==1 && tau_decay_mode_{1,2}==1
  a1(->1pi+2pi0): mva_dm_{1,2}==2 && tau_decay_mode_{1,2}==1 
  a1(->3pi):  mva_dm_{1,2}==10
